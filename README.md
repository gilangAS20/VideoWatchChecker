#  VIDEO WATCH CHECKER

## Hello everyone, welcome! :D

I just want to make a portofolio, this application will be like video checklist, when we finish watching a video it will give a sign then we can track which videos are not watch yet


### Here is the technology I want to use:

Backend: **C#**

Frontend: **WPF**

Database: **Postgre** with **EFCore**

Design Pattern: **MVVM(Model, View, View-Model)**

### I also make a design, use case diagram, etc

Diagram: [Diagram with draw.io](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-kHLYQQAsbcJy1UJWIVxb9ilWSVbHM1B/view?usp=sharing "Diagram with draw.io")

UI Design: [UI with Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/vY3h14f2ZC2K0pMUChzPP8/VideoWatchChecker?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=kEJqRUw995LbHF1r-1 "UI with Figma")
